# AUnit

A minimal template for using AUnit in PIO

## TODO

- [ ] Make connecting to serial easier
    - [ ] This might require linking Logic2API to a server or something so you're only using one cable. 
    - Or you an just jump the cable each time you wanna test it. Even better, you can just make another header on the board or an actual test point
- [ ] Test that mockstream works of course
