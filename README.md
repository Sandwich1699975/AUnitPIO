# AUnit

A minimal template for using AUnit in PIO

Must view output from serial for now

## Todo List

- Turns out the Unity wrapper sucks
    - [ ] Explore using AUnit by itself, but possibly using the python framework from PIO to scrape the serial output from logic2 api so I can still see the output of tests and stuff
